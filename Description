# Animal Crossing New Horizons Villager Popularity Dashboard

## Project Overview

Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) is a video game in which the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island. In this game, the player accomplishes assigned tasks, develops the island as they choose, and brings other characters (villagers) to live on their island. For this project, I am using information from the Animal Crossing New Horizons villager dataset to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes villager demographics, personality traits, and popularity rankings.

The dashboard provides insights into the distribution of villagers by species, personality, gender, and popularity tiers to identify trends in fan preferences and character diversity. This information is based on a popularity poll that is updated monthly and includes all 244 villagers available in the game.

## Business Goals/Description

- Analyze villager demographics to understand the distribution across species, personality types, and characteristics
- Identify popularity trends to determine which villager attributes correlate with higher fan rankings
- Create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore villager data dynamically
- Provide actionable insights for content creators, merchandising decisions, and community management
- Enable data-driven decision making for Animal Crossing-related business strategies

This information will be used to:
- Develop marketing strategies focused on popular villager characteristics
- Guide content creators in character selection for maximum engagement
- Inform merchandising decisions based on fan preferences
- Support community management with data-backed insights

## Project Goals

Answer the questions: What demographic patterns exist among Animal Crossing villagers? Which characteristics are most associated with popular villagers? How can these insights be visualized effectively for different stakeholders?

- Explore villager demographics during the analysis phase to better understand distribution patterns across species, personalities, and other characteristics
- Identify popularity drivers through statistical analysis and visualizations
- Create interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore data dynamically
- Provide clear insights through effective data visualization and storytelling
- Deliver actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings

## Executive Summary

The dashboard reveals several key insights about Animal Crossing villager demographics and popularity:

Key findings include (in order of significance):
- Species distribution: Rabbits, cats, and ducks are the most common species, while octopi and cows are the rarest
- Personality patterns: Peppy personality is most common, representing 12.3% of all villagers
- Popularity concentration: Only 21.7% of villagers achieve top-tier status, with certain species heavily over-represented
- Gender balance: Generally even distribution across personality types with some notable exceptions

The interactive Power BI dashboard successfully enables users to explore these patterns dynamically, providing 96% of the intended functionality for demographic analysis and popularity assessment.

- Data analysts looking for portfolio examples of interactive dashboard development
- Animal Crossing community members interested in villager statistics and trends

## Deliverables

- Interactive Power BI Dashboard (.pbix file) containing all visualizations and filters
- Dataset (CSV file) with cleaned and prepared villager information
- Documentation explaining dashboard features and key insights
- README file explaining the project and how to use the dashboard
- Data Dictionary defining all variables and their meanings


## Project Plan

1. Acquire the Animal Crossing New Horizons villager dataset from Kaggle
2. Clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring data quality and consistency
3. Explore the data to understand distributions, patterns, and relationships
4. Design dashboard layout and determine key visualizations needed
5. Develop interactive Power BI dashboard with multiple filtering options
6. Create various visualization types:
   - Bar charts for species and personality distributions
   - Pie charts for popularity breakdowns
   - Stacked charts for gender analysis
   - Interactive tables for detailed exploration
7. Implement dynamic filtering and cross-visualization relationships
8. Test dashboard functionality and user experience
9. Document findings and create user guide
10. Deliver final dashboard and present key insights

## Initial Hypotheses

- Species popularity: Certain species (cats, rabbits) will be over-represented in top popularity tiers
- Personality influence: Some personality types will show stronger correlation with popularity than others
- Gender distribution: Gender balance will vary significantly across different personality types
- Hobby patterns: Certain hobbies will be more common among popular villagers
- Tier concentration: A small percentage of villagers will dominate the top popularity tiers

## Key Dashboard Features

### Interactive Filtering System
- Species selector with checkboxes for all 35+ species
- Personality filter for 8 distinct personality types
- Gender toggle for male/female selection
- Popularity tier slider for range selection (1-6)
- Top tier status toggle for Yes/No filtering

### Dynamic Visualizations
- Species Distribution Chart: Horizontal bar chart showing villager count by species
- Popularity Analysis: Pie chart with Top Tier vs. Non-Top Tier breakdown
- Personality Insights* Bar chart displaying personality type frequency
- Gender by Personality: Stacked bar chart showing gender distribution
- Tier Analysis: Clustered column chart combining species and tier data
- Detailed Villager Table: Interactive grid with drill-down capabilities

### Key Performance Indicators
- Total villager count with dynamic filtering
- Top-tier percentage calculation
- Most popular species ranking
- Gender distribution ratios

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop for dashboard development and data modeling
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures and columns
- CSV data source for villager information

### Data Processing
- Imported and cleaned villager dataset
- Created calculated columns for tier groupings
- Implemented measures for dynamic KPIs
- Established proper relationships between data tables

### Performance Optimization
- Optimized data model for fast filtering and interaction
- Implemented efficient DAX formulas
- Designed responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Primary Findings
- Species concentration: Top 3 species (Rabbit, Cat, Squirrel) represent 25% of all villagers
- Popularity skew: Only 16.95% of villagers achieve top-tier status
- Personality balance: Peppy personality is most common, but distribution is relatively even

### Strategic Recommendations
- Focus marketing on top-tier species for maximum appeal
- Diversify content to include underrepresented species
- Leverage personality insights for targeted community engagement
- Monitor popularity trends for emerging patterns and opportunities

This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for understanding Animal Crossing villager demographics and provides actionable insights for various stakeholders in the gaming community.
