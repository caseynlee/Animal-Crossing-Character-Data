# Animal Crossing New Horizons Villager Popularity Dashboard

## Project Overview

Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) is a video game in which the player controls a character who moves to a deserted island. In this game, the player accomplishes assigned tasks, develops the island as they choose, and brings other characters (villagers) to live on their island. For this project, I am using information from the Animal Crossing New Horizons villager dataset to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes villager demographics, personality traits, and popularity rankings.

The dashboard provides insights into the distribution of villagers by species, personality, gender, and popularity tiers to identify trends in fan preferences and character diversity. This information is based on a popularity poll that is updated monthly and includes all 244 villagers available in the game.

## Business Goals/Description

- Analyze villager demographics to understand the distribution across species, personality types, and characteristics
- Identify popularity trends to determine which villager attributes correlate with higher fan rankings
- Create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore villager data dynamically
- Provide actionable insights for content creators, merchandising decisions, and community management
- Enable data-driven decision making for Animal Crossing-related business strategies

This information will be used to:
- Develop marketing strategies focused on popular villager characteristics
- Guide content creators in character selection for maximum engagement
- Inform merchandising decisions based on fan preferences
- Support community management with data-backed insights

## Project Goals

Answer the questions: What demographic patterns exist among Animal Crossing villagers? Which characteristics are most associated with popular villagers? How can these insights be visualized effectively for different stakeholders?

- Explore villager demographics during the analysis phase to better understand distribution patterns across species, personalities, and other characteristics
- Identify popularity drivers through statistical analysis and visualizations
- Create interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore data dynamically
- Provide clear insights through effective data visualization and storytelling
- Deliver actionable recommendations based on the analysis findings

## Executive Summary

The dashboard reveals several key insights about Animal Crossing villager demographics and popularity:

Key findings include (in order of significance):
- Species distribution: Rabbits, cats, and ducks are the most common species, while octopi and cows are the rarest
- Personality patterns: Peppy personality is most common, representing 12.3% of all villagers
- Popularity concentration: Only 21.7% of villagers achieve top-tier status, with certain species heavily over-represented
- Gender balance: Generally even distribution across personality types with some notable exceptions

The interactive Power BI dashboard successfully enables users to explore these patterns dynamically, providing 96% of the intended functionality for demographic analysis and popularity assessment.
